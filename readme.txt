IntelliCane Initial UI Build (Jeff McDonald)

This version of the app just has basic UI components for navigation. There is no built in functionality.

Items to be implemented:
	- Firebase Authorization/Login - Successful login should take you to the PatientSelectActivity
	- Use Firebase to populate PatientSelect and SessionSelect Activities
	- Data Visualizations on SessionViewActivity
